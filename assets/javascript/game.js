//Psuedo Code

// Need to set computer Guess to a random letter of the alphabet

// Need to set the start count with 0 wins, 0 losses, guesses left 9, and guesses so far-none

// Need to allow user to input a guess by clicking on the keyboard

// Need to compare user guess with computer guess

// If user guess is the same as computer guess Wins increases and losses stays at zero and reset

// If user guess is not the same as computer guess:

// display user guess, decreases Guesses left, keep checking user key value until user guess equals
// computer guess or until Guesses left is less than 1
